            </a>by Robert Bringhurst
                <br><br>
                Often referred to as "The Typographer's Bible," Chapter 6 of The Elements of Typographic Stylecovers Choosing and
                Combining Type. Bringhurst reminds us to "Choose faces that will survive, and if possible prosper, in the final screen
                conditions" and to "choose faces that suit the task as well as the subject." He tells us to "start with a single
                typographic family," but when the time comes to combine fonts, "balance the type optically more than mathematically."

                Nice Web Type strikes a balance between typographic artistry and technical know-how. In the "fonts" section of the site
                Brown writes, "You may have noticed, there are lots of typefaces out there to choose among. Here you'll find the ones I
                prefer, and my reasons."

For the Love of Type

<a href="#"><h3 class="articleTitle">The Elements of Typographic Style</h3></a>

While not a typographer himself, Bringhurst is a poet, with a love for ideas and a love for the letters and words used
to make ideas visible.The Elements of Typographic Style teaches the basics of honoring and respecting the written word
-- through choosing and combining typefaces; striving for rhythm, proportion, and harmony; and designing typographic
pages.

                    by John Boardley<br><br>
                    
                    From the website: I love Typography (ILT) was born on August 7, 2007. It exists because I have a passion for typography,
                    type design, and lettering, and for the words born of those disciplines. As a child I wondered why the teacher asked us
                    to draw the letter a as an o with a tail, when in my books, the a’s had an extra bit at the top. This site aims to make
                    the subject more accessible, to bring the study of typography to the masses, if you will. It's just about impossible to
                    imagine a world without type, but at the same time type's ubiquity has most of us taking it for granted. So take a
                    closer look." ilovetypography.com

                    Love and Joy About Letters
                    </h3></a>
                    by Ben Shahn<br><br>
                    
                    Ben Shahn was a muralist, photographer, and printmaker whose work often including lettering. When he was 14, he was
                    apprenticed to a lithographer. In Love and Joy About Letters he writes: "I discovered the Roman alphabet in all its
                    elegance and its austere dignity, and I fell in love all over again with letters… Letters are quantities, and spaces are
                    quantities, and only the eye and the hand can measure them. As in the ear and the sensibilities of the poet sounds and
                    syllables and pauses are quantities, so in both cases are the balancing and forward movement of these quantities only a
                    matter of skill and feeling and art."
